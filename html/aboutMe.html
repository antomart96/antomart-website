                <p  class="reveal animationText">
                    Hello, my name is Antoine, and I am determined to pursue a career in the field of computer science. 
                    Currently, I am studying for a Bachelor's Degree in Business Computing through evening classes to enhance my skills.
                    I found my way into the IT field through an intensive 4-month bootcamp programme organised by Cap4Lab and ADEM, which allowed me to become a skillful junior full-stack developer.<br><br>

                    My goal is to continue to refine and evolve in this field through the acquisition of new skills and by taking on exciting new challenges. 
                    Alongside this, I have a passion for climbing, an activity that pushes me to overcome my limits and cultivate perseverance. 
                    Additionally, I enjoy running to maintain a physical and mental balance, and reading is an endless source of knowledge and inspiration for me<br><br>
                    
                    I am excited about the prospect of combining my passion for programming with my desire for personal and professional development, and I am ready to scale new heights in the world of computer science.

                        I discovered climbing at school eleven years ago and it has become my passion ever since.  
                        I mainly practice in indoor climbing gyms. However, two years ago I decided to climb more regularly and explore outdoor climbing. 
                        The feeling of climbing over 30 metres up a cliff, surrounded by breathtaking views, is truly unique. 
                        The rush of adrenaline as I push myself to new heights is an experience like no other. 
                        My goal is to try ice climbing in the long term. The idea of climbing steep, icy walls is immensely appealing to me. 
                        Climbing is more than just a sport for me, it's a constant adventure, a source of joy, and a sense of accomplishment. 
                        Every day spent climbing brings new experiences and skills, and I am excited to discover what the future holds in this exciting world.

                        I recently rekindled my interest in running to improve my physical fitness. 
                        This decision is partly driven by my passion for outdoor rock climbing, as access to certain areas sometimes requires following steep mountain trails. 
                        A good stamina is an important asset in order to succeed in these high altitude hikes. 
                        What particularly motivates me is running in the woods. 
                        There's nothing like the feeling of escaping into nature. You're sheltered by the trees and you can enjoy the landscape and the fresh air. 
                        It's an invigorating experience that allows me to recharge while improving my stamina. 
                        Running is a way  of connecting with nature, disconnecting from daily stress, and taking the time to appreciate the beauty of the world around me. 
                        It's an escape, a source of wellbeing.

                        I also rekindled my interest in reading by immersing myself in the book "Atomic Habits" because I felt the need to break some bad habits, in particular the constant attachment to my smartphone. 
                        As I consider a career in the field of computer science, I realise that I am often exposed to screens. 
                        Reading allows me to escape from this screen dependency while giving my eyes a break. 
                        It is a way to educate myself and learn new things while balancing my digital life. 
                        Reading has become a valuable sanctuary, a welcome break from the digital world, where I can rest my eyes while nourishing my mind.
