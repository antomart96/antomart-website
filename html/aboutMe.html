                <p  class="reveal animationText">
                    Hello, my name is Antoine, and I am determined to embark on a career in the field of computer science. 
                    Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Business Computing through evening classes to enhance my skills. 
                    I found my path in the field of IT through an intensive 4-month Bootcamp program organized by Cap4Lab and ADEM, which allowed me to become a competent junior full-stack developer.<br><br>

                    My goal is to continue to refine and evolve in this field by acquiring new skills and taking on exciting challenges. 
                    In parallel, I have a passion for climbing, an activity that pushes me to push my limits and cultivate perseverance. 
                    Additionally, I enjoy running to maintain a physical and mental balance, and reading is an endless source of knowledge and inspiration for me.<br><br>
                    
                    I am excited about the prospect of combining my passion for programming with my desire for personal and professional development, and I am ready to scale new heights in the world of computer science.

                        Eleven years ago, I discovered climbing at school, and since then, it has become my passion. 
                        I primarily practice in indoor climbing gyms, but two years ago, I decided to climb more regularly and explore outdoor climbing. 
                        The feeling of ascending over 30 meters on a cliff, surrounded by breathtaking views, is truly unique. 
                        The adrenaline rush as I progress to new heights is an incomparable experience. 
                        In the long term, my goal is to try ice climbing. The idea of climbing steep, icy walls is immensely appealing to me. 
                        Climbing is more than just a sport, it's a continuous adventure, a source of joy, and a sense of accomplishment for me.
                        Each day spent climbing brings new experiences and skills, and I am eager to discover what the future holds in this exciting world.

                        I recently rekindled my interest in running to improve my physical fitness. 
                        This decision is partly driven by my passion for outdoor rock climbing, as access to certain areas sometimes requires traversing steep mountain trails. 
                        Having strong endurance is a significant asset for succeeding in these elevation hikes.
                        What particularly motivates me is running in the woods. 
                        There's nothing quite like the feeling of escaping into nature, sheltered by the trees, all while taking in the landscape and the refreshing air. 
                        It's a revitalizing experience that allows me to recharge while improving my endurance.
                        Running is a way to connect with nature, disconnect from daily stress, and take the time to appreciate the beauty of the world around me. 
                        It's an escape, a source of well-being.

                        I rekindled my interest in reading too by immersing myself in the book "Atomic Habits" because I felt the need to break free from certain bad habits, particularly the constant attachment to my smartphone. 
                        As I consider a career in the field of computer science, I realize that I am often exposed to screens. 
                        Reading allows me to escape from this screen dependency while giving my eyes a break. It is a way to educate myself and learn new things while balancing my digital life. 
                        Reading has become a valuable sanctuary, a welcome break from the digital world, where I can rest my eyes while nourishing my mind.
